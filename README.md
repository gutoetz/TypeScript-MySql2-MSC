# Backend Project

This project is a Backend application developed using the MSC (Model, Service, Controller) pattern, TypeScript, MySQL2, Express, Sequelize, and Docker. It provides functionalities for user login, user registration, product registration, and purchase management. The project includes route definitions and other features to support these operations.

## Overview

The Backend Project serves as the server-side component for user authentication, user registration, product registration, and purchase management. It follows the MSC (Model, Service, Controller) pattern to structure the codebase, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. The project utilizes TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience, MySQL2 as the relational database management system, Express as the web application framework, Sequelize as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, and Docker for containerization.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries were utilized in the development of this project:

- MSC Architecture: The MSC (Model, Service, Controller) architecture pattern separates the application logic into distinct layers, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
- TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides type checking and enhanced JavaScript features, resulting in improved code quality and maintainability.
- MySQL2: MySQL2 is a widely used relational database management system that provides efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.
- Express: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building APIs.
- Sequelize: Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js that supports multiple database systems. It simplifies database operations and provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the database.
- Docker: Docker is used for containerization, enabling the creation of isolated environments and simplified deployment.

## Functionality

The Backend Project offers the following functionality:

- User Authentication: It provides APIs for user login, verifying user credentials, and generating authentication tokens.
- User Registration: The application allows users to register by providing their information, such as name, email, and password.
- Product Registration: It provides APIs for registering products, including details such as name, description, and price.
- Purchase Management: The project allows the management of purchases, including associating purchases with users and products, and tracking purchase details.
- API Endpoints: The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints for seamless integration with frontend or client applications.
